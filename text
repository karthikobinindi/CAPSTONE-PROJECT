UI Automation using Selenium with Python (Pytest & Robot Framework)

Project Title
E-Commerce Application – End-to-End UI Automation Capstone Project

Project Overview
The objective of this capstone project is to design, develop, and execute an end-to-end UI automation framework for a generic E-Commerce web application using the following technologies:
Selenium WebDriver with Python
Pytest Framework
Robot Framework
The project demonstrates real-world automation practices, including:
Page Object Model (POM)
Data-driven testing
Configuration management
Screenshot handling
Reporting
CI-ready test execution
This automation framework should be reusable, scalable, and adaptable for any standard e-commerce application.

Application Under Test (AUT)
Generic E-Commerce Web Application
(The specific e-commerce site will be mentioned above)
User Roles
Customer / End User
Seller / Vendor
Admin

Functional Scope (Features to Automate)
End-to-End Scenarios (Minimum 5)
#
Scenario
Description
1
User Registration & Login
User registers and logs into the application successfully
2
Product Search & Product Details
User searches for a product and views product details
3
Add to Cart
User adds one or more products to the shopping cart
4
Update Cart & Remove Item
User updates product quantity and removes items from the cart
5
User Logout & Session Validation
User logs out and session is terminated properly


Automation Scope
Framework 1: Selenium with Python + Pytest
Key Requirements
Page Object Model (POM)
Pytest fixtures for setup and teardown
Parameterized test cases
Externalized configuration (config.ini)
Separate test data files (JSON / CSV)
Screenshot capture on test failure
Custom HTML reports (pytest-html / Allure)
Multiple assertions per test case
Modular and reusable components
Sample Folder Structure
pytest-framework/
├── config/
├── data/
├── pages/
├── tests/
├── reports/
├── screenshots/
├── utilities/
└── pytest.ini

Framework 2: Selenium with Python + Robot Framework
Key Requirements
Keyword-driven testing approach
SeleniumLibrary
Resource and variable files
Data-driven testing using DataDriver
Suite and test setup/teardown
Screenshot capture for failed test steps
Default Robot Framework reports and logs
Reusable keywords
Modular test suites
Sample Folder Structure
robot-framework/
├── tests/
├── keywords/
├── resources/
├── variables/
├── reports/
└── output.xml

Common Automation Requirements (Applicable to Both Frameworks)
Use multiple locator strategies (id, name, xpath, cssSelector)
Implement explicit waits
Browser configuration should be externalized (Chrome / Firefox)
Cross-browser support (optional)
Follow Python, Selenium, and automation best practices
Add meaningful logging
Tests should be executable from the command line

Test Execution
Pytest Execution
pytest -v --html=reports/report.html
Robot Framework Execution
robot -d reports tests/

Deliverables
UI automation framework using Pytest
UI automation framework using Robot Framework
Automated test cases for all five end-to-end scenarios
HTML execution reports
Screenshots for failed test cases
Git repository with proper documentation

Evaluation Criteria
Framework design and folder structure
Code reusability and modularization
Usage of Page Object Model and reusable keywords
Test coverage and assertion quality
Reporting and failure handling
Adherence to automation best practices

Outcome
By completing this capstone project, learners will gain hands-on experience in building industry-standard UI automation frameworks using Selenium with Python, preparing them for real-time automation testing roles.
